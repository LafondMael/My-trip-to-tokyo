        <h1>Planned a trip to Tokyo ?</h1>

        <p>
          Tokyo is a dizzying whirl of activity: you can practically feel it
          pulse, with the neon signs, the crush of people, and the perfectly
          punctual, high-speed trains whizzing by. Then there’s a pause, a bit
          of green and calm on the city’s temple grounds or classical gardens.
          There’s a varied cultural landscape full of futuristic skyscrapers,
          those centuries-old temples, sophisticated hotels, and enticing
          restaurants.
        </p>

        <p>
          More than any one sight, it's the city itself that enchants visitors.
          It's a sprawling, organic thing, stretching as far as the eye can see.
          Always changing, and with a diverse collection of neighbourhoods, no
          two experiences of the city are ever the same. Some neighbourhoods
          feel like a vision from the future, with ever taller, sleeker
          structures popping up each year; others evoke the past with low-slung
          wooden buildings and glowing lanterns radiating surprising warmth;
          elsewhere, drab concrete blocks hide art galleries and cocktail bars
          and every lane hints at possible discoveries.
        </p>

        <h3>Art and Culture</h3>

        <p>
          In Tokyo you can experience the whole breadth of Japanese arts and
          culture. Centuries-old forms of performing arts still play on stages
          and sumo tournaments draw crowds; every spring, Tokyoites head outside
          to appreciate the cherry blossoms – a tradition older than the city
          itself. There are museums covering every era of Japanese art history
          and also ones that focus on the contemporary – challenging the old
          distinctions between art with a capital A, pop culture and technology.
          But there's a playful side to all of this, too: Tokyo is, after all, a
          city whose public artworks include a scale model of an anime robot.
        </p>

        <h3>Tokyo food's scene</h3>

        <p>
          When it comes to Tokyo superlatives, the city's food scene tops the
          list. But we're not just talking about the famous restaurants and the
          celebrity chefs: what Tokyo excels at is consistency across the board.
          Wherever you are, you're usually within 100m of a good, if not great,
          restaurant. It's a scene that careens nonchalantly between the highs
          and lows: it's not unusual for a top-class sushi restaurant to share
          the same block as an oil-spattered noodle joint, and for both to be
          equally adored. Tokyoites love dining out; join them, and delight in
          the sheer variety of tastes and experiences the city has to offer.
        </p>

        <h3>Otaku experiences</h3>

        <p>
          Explore the weird and wonderful world of otaku - the so-called ‘geek
          culture’ of gaming superfans - in Akihabara, the district famed for
          it. You'll explore districts like Ikebukuro and Akihabara and discover
          all things anime, manga and cosplay. In Japan, anyone obsessed with
          these things are called otaku, and in Akihabara, they flaunt their
          fixations in the form of cosplay, intricate costumes of their favorite
          characters complete with rainbow-colored wigs.
